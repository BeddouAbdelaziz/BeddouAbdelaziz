# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my profile! I'm **Beddou Abdelaziz** 🙋‍♂️ a third-year student at the national institute of electrical and electronic engineering⚡**IGEE**(Ex-INELEC) in Boumerdes.

I recently got into coding 💻 because i find it interesting and i believe it will prove beneficial to my career since it provides a lot of opportunities and it's highly demanded.

I'm willing to stay consistent and keep learning differernt skills and engage in events as well as interacting with communities.
